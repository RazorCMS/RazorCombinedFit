These packages will provide a tool for CLs calculations.  Use
cls_analysis.py (see its documentation) to run the code.

Overview of files:
cls_analysis.py: Runs workspace_preparer.C, then Standard...Demo.C.
Has optional flags for input.

StandardHypoTestInvDemo.C: Performs the actual cls calculations.  Needs a
  specially formatted workspace passed to it.

workspace_preparer.C: Prepares this specially formatted workspace.
, etc.

run.sh: an example that shows how to run the program on Josh's data (which
was not included).

THE OUTPUT: Currently, the CLs values are produced as text in the standard
output.  The final graphs are saved as ***.ps


Also: The attached RooRazor2DSignal files are the ones I currently use.
Put them in the right place so that the make command compiles them.
